don't change the existing code because I need all the thing just make small changes in this app that I given below
1)Make Post Preview Aspect Ratio Like In Instagram If We Upload a Landscape Instagram video Means in Preview It show just Like Landscape Video But In Realtime Instagram It Shows Upside Some Black Space and Downside Some Black Space Just in Centre Only It Shows Video So make Post Preview Use By Aspect Ratio Of the Video In Realtime Instagram Preview And Also Same for Image Also Make Realtime Instagram preview
2)make a tuning in follower growth graph on mobile view because in mobile view it look like too messy make an adjustment on mobile view on follower growth graph like remove 2 data in mobile view like that
3)in gender graph in output it tells percentage correctly but the height cant set to percentage so the height of the graph cant change fix it
4)if we touch the hamburger menu it doesn't show the menu option like dashboard  content creation like that fix hamburger menu
5)remove the platform selection on main page remove Instagram add platform selection header because if the user need to see only Instagram analytics means it only shown on dashboard same thing in content creation on contention page it particular ask where u need to upload all or particularly instagram like that and also for analytics also all or instagram like that we need to select this all like dropdown menu on that menu an option like add account and that dropdown it only show instagram logo and there instagra user id in future youtube means it shows instagram logo and instagram channel name like that
6)if the user click add platform or account means in any page  it shows a 80 % screen pop up and shows which all are the platform available to connect just like sprout social
7)add the background colour for follower growth as var(--color-background)
8)the all analytics data must come from Realtime of that particular account for that function if u need any ai key like that means ask me got it
9)on onboarding tour if the user come as new user just create id an came means ask onboarding details just like sprout social like it should ask which platform to connect here basically we have instagram so it show instagram to connect after that it need to show the terms and conditions like the insta page must be business account and facebook page and Instagram page must be in same account and insta page must be admin like sprout social and policy like meta developer after that accept it show authorize after click that it redirect to facebook authorization for authorize the app for that u can use node js and express js after authorization it tells weather connected or not connected means it show success message like sprote social or not connected means it tells error message that message must need to understand by the normal user error like user friendly after connect the page only the onboarding tour should runs like dashboard do these thing content creation do these thing like that the onboarded should point out all the page and work case the use need to give next next like that 
10) these above all condition must be satisfy by your output without error and I want clear output and good code management and file and folder management also without changing the existing code because in existing code I can some code like command line some code that command line code also I needed don't delete it got it these 10 point all must be as same as sprote social app make reference on there
