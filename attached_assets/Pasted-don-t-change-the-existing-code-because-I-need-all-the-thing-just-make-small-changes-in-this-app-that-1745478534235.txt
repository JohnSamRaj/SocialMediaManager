don't change the existing code because I need all the thing just make small changes in this app that I given below
1)after successfully post or anything it show susses message not alert message
2)in content creation make preview like sprout social and add a option to select the platform here in content creation make Realtime ai it need to give description and hash tag about the video 
3)if the user click on content creation page means the sidebar should shrink and made a space for network preview of Instagram if the user add video or image in dropdown means in network preview it shows user id and added image profile upload date and description this way if the user add media mean in real time the network preview shows a preview to user the network preview like sprote social
4)make a tuning in follower growth graph on mobile view becuase in mobile view it look like too messy make an adjustment on mobile view on follower growth graph
5)in gender table in output it tells percentage correctly but the height cant set to percentage so the height of the graph cant change fix it
6)if we touch the hamburger menu it doent show the menu option like dashboard  content creation like that fix hamburger menu
7)remove the platform selection on main page remove Instagram add platform selection header because if the user need to see only insatagram anyktics means it only shown on dashboard same thing in content creation on contention page it particular ask where u need to upload all or particulary insata like that and also for analytics also all or insta like that we need to select this all like dropdown menu on that menu an option like add acc and that dropdwn it only show insta logo and there insta user id in future youtube means it shows ista logo and insta channel name like that
8)if the user click add platform or account means in any page  it shows a 80 % screen pop up and shows which all are the platform available to connect just like sproute social
9)add the backround color for follower growth as var(--color-background)
10)the all analytics data must come from realtime of that particular accont for that function if u need any ai key like thata means ask me got it
11)on onboarding tour if the user come as new user just create id an came means ask onboding details just like sproute social like it should ask which platform to connect here basically we have insstagram so it show instagram to connect after that it need to show the terms and conditions like the insta page must be business account and facbook page and Instagram page must be in same acc and insta page must be admin like sproute social and pilocy like meta developer after that accept it show authorize after click that it redirect to facebook autoriztion for authorize the app for that u can use node js and express js after autorizaation it tells weather connected or not connected means it show success meassage like sprote social or not connected means it tells error message that message must need to understand by the normal user error like user friendly after connect the page only the onboading tour should runs like dashboard do these thing content creation do these thing like that the onboarded should point out all the page and workcase the use need to give next next like that these 11 point all must be as same as sprote social app make referece on there  
12) these above all condition must be satisfy by your output without error and I want clear output and good code management and file and folder manage ment also without changing the exsisting code because in exsisting code I can some code like command line some code that cpmmand line code also I needed don't delete it got it
